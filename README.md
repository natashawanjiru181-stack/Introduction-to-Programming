# Introduction-to-Programming 
*General introduction*
This repository contains one main folder 'Introduction to Programming ipynb files' containing all the Jupyter files I used when learning Introduction to Programming in University.  
Four sub folders inside it namely: Lessons, Assignments, Exams and Python.  
Lessons folder contains all that I was taught during class time.  
Assignments folder contains all the extra work I was given after class.  
Exams folder contains files I practiced in to prepare for my Mid Semester exams,End Semester exams and files on what to expect in exam.
